This was initially done just to lessen the pain when assessing SNMP services across non-standard SNMP ports.
Rather than have to re-compile it time after time I rigged it now so that the -p argument will allow you
to scan a non-standard port.

it will also work across an entire list of hosts and output cleanly, unlikely my early attempts.
